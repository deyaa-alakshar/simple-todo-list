4. I used context api because that give you :
   Reduced Prop Drilling: As your component tree grows deeper, passing data through props becomes cumbersome and error-prone. Context API provides a centralized way to share data across components at any level of the hierarchy.
   Improved Code Organization : By storing shared data in Context, you keep your components cleaner and more focused on their specific functionalities. This separation of concerns enhances code maintainability and readability.
   State Management for Global Data: Context API is particularly useful for managing state that needs to be accessed by numerous components throughout your application. It serves as a centralized location to store and update this global state, simplifying state management and reducing boilerplate code.
   Flexibility: You can create multiple contexts within your application to manage different sets of shared data. This allows for better organization and separation of concerns in complex applications.
